# ECE2150J-Introduction-to-Circuits-Most-Complete-Repository

### Course Description

Introduction to electric circuits. Basic concepts of voltage and current; Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws; Ohm’s law; voltage and current sources; Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits; DC and low active circuits using operational amplifiers; energy and power. Time- and frequency-domain analysis of RLC circuits. Basic passive and active electronic filters. Laboratory experience with electrical signals and circuits.

### Author Remark

Course contents are a subset of those in books. Lecture Slides are like RCs of books, and no RC needed for loss of information. Lab solutions are not attached, as they hardly make a difference in the score, while lab explorations are highly encouraged. Slides exercises, homework, and exams align well. Read slides carefully, understand each and every example, and you will be clear of confusions. Practice makes perfect. Suitable for 100% self-learning. But be critical about AI usage, as AI has difficulty understanding circuits.
